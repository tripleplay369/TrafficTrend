# TrafficTrend

A Chrome extension that displays the current travel time and trend for traffic between two locations. Great for deciding when to leave work.

Specify a start address and a destination address, and Traffic Trend keeps track of the traffic conditions between the two locations.  The current travel time is always displayed in a badge on the extension's icon, and the icon changes color based on the current traffic trend.  Great for deciding when to leave work.
